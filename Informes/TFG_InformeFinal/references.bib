               segmentation",

  abstract  = "In the last decade, research on artificial intelligence has seen
               rapid growth with deep learning models, especially in the field
               of medical image segmentation. Various studies demonstrated that
               these models have powerful prediction capabilities and achieved
               similar results as clinicians. However, recent studies revealed
               that the evaluation in image segmentation studies lacks reliable
               model performance assessment and showed statistical bias by
               incorrect metric implementation or usage. Thus, this work
               provides an overview and interpretation guide on the following
               metrics for medical image segmentation evaluation in binary as
               well as multi-class problems: Dice similarity coefficient,
               Jaccard, Sensitivity, Specificity, Rand index, ROC curves,
               Cohen's Kappa, and Hausdorff distance. Furthermore, common
               issues like class imbalance and statistical as well as
               interpretation biases in evaluation are discussed. As a summary,
               we propose a guideline for standardized medical image
               segmentation evaluation to improve evaluation quality,
               reproducibility, and comparability in the research field.",

abstract = {In this paper, we present an extensive review on deep learning methods for image restoration tasks. Deep learning techniques, led by convolutional neural networks, have received a great deal of attention in almost all areas of image processing, especially in image classification. However, image restoration is a fundamental and challenging topic and plays significant roles in image processing, understanding and representation. It typically addresses image deblurring, denoising, dehazing and super-resolution. There are substantial differences in the approaches and mechanisms in deep learning methods for image restoration. Discriminative learning based methods are able to deal with issues of learning a restoration mapping function effectively, while optimisation models based methods can further enhance the performance with certain learning constraints. In this paper, we offer a comparative study of deep learning techniques in image denoising, deblurring, dehazing, and super-resolution, and summarise the principles involved in these tasks from various supervised deep network architectures, residual or skip connection and receptive field to unsupervised autoencoder mechanisms. Image quality criteria are also reviewed and their roles in image restoration are assessed. Based on our analysis, we further present an efficient network for deblurring and a couple of multi-objective training functions for super-resolution restoration tasks. The proposed methods are compared extensively with the state-of-the-art methods with both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Finally, we point out potential challenges and directions for future research.}
